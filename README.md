### Download VS Code and create index.html file
1. First things first. We need the right tools for the right job. (Download VsCode)[] if you dont already have it.
2. Open VS code and create a new file called index.html
3. Copy and paste this html and css into the file
```html <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

    <head>
        <style>
            html,
            body {
                overflow: hidden;
                width: 100%;
                height: 100%;
                margin: 0;
                padding: 0;
                text-align: center;
            }

            #renderCanvas {
                width: 100%;
                height: 100%;
                touch-action: none;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <canvas id="renderCanvas"></canvas>
        <script src="dist/index.js"></script>
    </body>

</html>
